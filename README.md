# passmanager

Stateless password manager written in Python, based on the Python script from Stephen Boyer's post here: https://www.stephanboyer.com/post/101/hashpass-a-stateless-password-manager-for-chrome

I've made a few modifications to the script and am posting it here for personal use and for others to use as well.
